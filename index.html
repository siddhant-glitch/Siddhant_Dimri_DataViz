		<h1 id="head">Olympic Data Vizualization</h1>
		<h3>Data is inaccurate in 1916, 1940 and 1944 because of World War I and World War II. Data is more sparse in 1980 because the Olympics were boycotted by the USA and other countries. Winter and Summer Olympics were held in the same year until 1994 (Lillehammer, Norway) when they began alternating every two years (as seen in gender graphs).</h3>

		<h2>Canada's history at the Olympics</h2>
		<p>The nation made its debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Canada competes under the IOC country code CAN. Canada has hosted the Summer Olympic Games once, in 1976 in Montreal, and the Winter Olympic Games twice, in Calgary, Alberta in 1988 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 2010. Canada has sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games and almost every Summer Olympic Games since its debut at the 1900 games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, which it boycotted. Canada has won at least one medal at every Olympics in which it has competed. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) is the National Olympic Committee for Canada.
		At the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was hosted in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the country won more gold medals than any other competing nation for the first time. The chart below shows the total number of medals won each year.

		<h2>Medals won by Canada hockey team</h2>
		<p>In the men's tournament, Canada was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. Czechoslovakia, Sweden and the United States were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals.

The United States won gold medals in 1960 and in 1980, which included their "Miracle on Ice" upset of the Soviet Union.

		<h2>Top Five Countries in the Olympics</h2>
		<p>The all-time medal table for all five countries from 1896 to 2018, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games. The IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.

		<h2>Women at the Olympic Games</h2>
		<p>Since 1991, any new sports seeking to be included on the Olympic programme have been required to include women's events, while the IOC has also worked closely with the International Sports Federations (IFs) to stimulate womenâ€™s involvement in sport through more participation opportunities at the Olympic Games. Women continue to be underrepresented as coaching staff at the Olympic Games. The Gender Equality Review Project has highlighted the need to address the imbalance in coaching.
